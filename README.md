<p>Use the provided Photoshop design to create the website home page using HTML and CSS. It will be given to the design manager for approval before it is converted to a PHP website.</p>

# Deliverable C – Customer browsing
<h2>Dynamic Web project build stream</h2>
<p>For this deliverable the application enables customers to view featured items on the home page, browse, search for items and contact sports warehouse using the contact page.  
A database needs to be created with the correct tables, columns and relationships. The products and categories are stored in the database. 
</p>
<h2>Section A - Home page requirements</h2>
<p>The home page for the website displays the store’s featured items. These are items that have been marked as featured in the database. Use SQL to retrieve the data. For each item display the item photo, price, sale price (if applicable) and product name.</p>
<h3>Categories</h3>
<p>The items for sale are organised into categories. An item belongs to just one category and categories can have many items. The categories displayed in the website are stored in the database. Use SQL to retrieve the data.
These categories are displayed towards the top of the page and in the footer.</p>
<h2>Section B - Contact us page</h2>
<p>The contact page was created in deliverable A – pre-launch. This deliverable involves editing the page layout so it fits with the rest of the site. The contact page can be accessed by clicking on the “Contact Us” link in the top navigation, and at the bottom of the page.</p>
<h2>Section C - Browsing by category</h2>
<p>The user can browse the site to view the items for sale. The items can be browsed by selecting the category. When a category is selected all the items that belong to the category are displayed.
For each item, display:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item name</li>
<li>Price and sale price if applicable</li>
<li>Photo of item</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section D - Searching for an item</h2>
<p>The user can search for an item by providing the item name or part of the name. Use SQL to retrieve the data.
For each item, display:</p>
<ul>
<li>Item name</li>
<li>Price and sale price if applicable</li>
<li>Photo of item</li>
</ul>
<h2>Section E - Viewing an item</h2>
